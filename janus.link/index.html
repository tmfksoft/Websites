<h3>What is Janus?</h3>
<p>Janus, written in Perl, is an IRC service daemon that allows individual networks to selectively and transparently share channels over a greater Janus network. In a way, it behaves like a relay bot, except all channels are linked server-side (i.e. you can see remote users as if they were on the same network as you). All channel sharing is managed through a Janus Control Interface.</p>
<p>Although the concept of Janus is perfectly valid, the current implementation <span class="main">does have it's own <a href="#">drawbacks</a>.</span><span class="spoiler">suffers from a range of issues: messy/outdated code, and software bugs that <em>severely</em> impact usability (and <a href="/janusissues/15.htm">never</a> <a href="/janusissues/16.htm">get</a> <a href="/janusissues/17.htm">fixed</a>).</span></p>
<p>Janus supports multiple IRCds<span class="main">, from UnrealIRCd to InspIRCd to TS6-based networks (charybdis, etc.)!</span><span class="spoiler"> supposedly, but the only protocol that's actually usable (doesn't randomly create ghost users or cause protocol violation on overly long nicknames) at the moment is UnrealIRCd. Boo hoo!</span></p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p><b>10/09/2014</b>: Janus maintainer decides to pull the <a href="https://github.com/Trixarian/janus2/issues">entire Janus repository</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/Trixarian/janus/issues">create a new one</a>) after learning of this site! The mirror for the issues is <a href="/janusissues/">here</a>.</p>
<ul><li>So much for misguided rants, eh? <b>Show some love, everyone!</b> :^)</li></ul>
